# On The Map

**On the Map** is an app made in fulfillment of my Udacity iOS Nanodegree.

The app allows users to share their location and a website url with other users.
The app interfaces with a udacity API for login and auth and a custom parse API
to get and write data for student locations and websites.

This app was done as an assignment for my Udacity iOS nanodegree. there are many
apps like it out there.(you van probably find some on github) but the codebase and
storyboards were all started from scratch. You can find info on the project
specifcations at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPF1tmSzVYPSbpl7_JCeMKglKMIs3dUa4OrSAKEYNAs/pub?embedded=true

If you're working on your own **On The Map** project, feel free to use mine for inspiration!

Thanks for checking it out!
